# Mobile Student Ambassador Portal

## Problem
### Client-side:  
The client currently had twenty student ambassadors embedded in US universities and wanted to scale the program to 1000, while ensuring quality programming and effective brand representation.  

### User-side:  
The role of an ambassador is murky and students are tasked with creating effective demo materials and promoting events with little guidance or support.  They also typically have minimal free time in their time-intensive majors (engineering, comp sci, bio-engineering, etc.).  In addition, the [professional community group](1-empathy.png) is very unfriendly to students.

## Process
We interviewed students, typical product users, and performed a competitive analysis of other ambassador programs.  We used the data to [model the ambassador's key tasks](2-taskanalysis.png) and, using personas with different experience levels, identified [three essential, inter-related functions](3-functions.jpg): 
* pre-built material packages; 
* a step-by-step event planner; and 
* community.  

We iterated with [several approaches](4-wireframes.jpg), including early prototypes for desktop, web, and application plug-in.

## Solution
Our final solution was a [mobile prototype](5-finalprototype.png) that takes advantage of in-between moments, helping ambassadors easily switch focus to an infrequent responsibility.  The main screen houses the to-do list using a card-type interaction, and pulls the next most important task in each functional area.  Student attendees also have access to the app for event RSVP, limited access to the presented materials, and connecting to the community at large, and building continuity from novice user to brand ambassador to professional user.
